# Real Time Sentiment Analysis from a Phone Call
 Using this cade, one can analysis the sentiment of the real time audio

# To do this project, You need to download below python packages:
	* textblob (https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)
	* nltk (https://www.nltk.org/)
	* SpeechRecognition (https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
	* PyAudio

# Working Process
	* Using textblob and nltk, I first analysis the sentiment from a sentence.
	* In second phase, Using PyAudio and SpeechRecognition, I detect the realtime audio (in English). That audio then converted into text and analysis is done.
	* You can run the last segment of the code for longer conversation.
